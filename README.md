# Motor-Control
This project utilizes pulse-width modulation motor control to drive a set of motors to manipulate the speeds and directions so when installed a mobile chassis, the machine could change speeds, directions and the like.Â 

This project was simulated on TinkerCad @ https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2Dzbn0IEkpo-motor-control/editel
